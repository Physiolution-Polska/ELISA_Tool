ELISA Tool a collection of data analysis tools in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

Status: going

## Introduction

The solution is intended to create and test such a model of processing measurement
results, which minimizes the probability of user mistake and the risk of loosing information
about data processing up to the final stage of reporting according to SOP.
ipate in its development. The ELISA Tool (ET) presented at work has been implemented
as an extension of another opensource tool, DataExplore (DE) [8] data analysis program.
The modular structure of the solution will allow its easy implementation in a web services
form under Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) or Electronic LaboratoryNotebook (ELN)

## Installation

Requires python>=3.5, dataexplore, numpy, matplotlib and pandas. Additional required modules listed in the requirements.txt file (use: '''$ pipreqs elisa_tool_plug.py''').
